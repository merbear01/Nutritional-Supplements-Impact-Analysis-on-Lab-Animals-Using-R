# Nutritional Supplements Impact Analysis on Lab Animals Using R
This repository contains the R scripts and datasets used in my analysis of the effects of nutritional supplements on the weight of mice and rats. This study was conducted as part of my coursework in the Department of Computing & Mathematical Sciences at the University of Greenwich.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to statistically analyze the impact of nutritional supplements on the weight of 200 rats and 200 mice before and after treatment. Using R, a variety of statistical tests were performed to determine the significance of the treatment effects. The analysis included parametric and non-parametric tests, fitting distributions, and hypothesis testing.
Therefore we will create a dataset for the rats and mice and test them based on these criteria:
 T-test	statistic
 Degrees	of	freedom
 P-value
 Confidence	Interval
 Sample	estimates

# Key Findings
1. Analysis revealed significant weight changes in both mice and rats post-treatment.
2. Parametric tests showed convincing evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection for the mice dataset.
3. Non-parametric tests confirmed significant differences in the rats' weight post-treatment.
4. Best fit distributions for weight data were identified, with Weibull distribution providing the best fit based on several statistical criteria.

# Technologies Used
R: Used for all statistical analysis and data visualization.
Packages: ggplot2 for visualization, dplyr for data manipulation, shapiro.test for normality testing, among others.
